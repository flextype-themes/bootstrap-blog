<p>Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. It's information about the future isn't it.

On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advise, I'll never forget it. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Let's put him in there.</p>
