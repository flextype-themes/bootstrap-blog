<p>Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.</p><p><br></p><p>His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. What's the meaning of this. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.</p><p><br></p><p>I can't play. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Lorraine. Marty, why are you so nervous? You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?</p>
